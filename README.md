# Automated-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Deep-Learning
We have implemented an automatic DR grading system which is capable of image classification based on disease pathologies from four severity levels and which determines the sensitivity and specificity of 4-ary classification models. To enhance sensitivities of mild and early classes, we are planning to train the multi-class models including various methods of data pre-processing and data augmentation.
